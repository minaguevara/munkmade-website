            <p>To keep it brief, everything on the page is art. But here we are only talking about still art; 
                covers, banners, portraits, and other types of 3D imagery. I chose to showcase cover art since 
                its the primary catagory that has allowed me to really show what I can do. Most of these pieces 
                also came with extra photo packs and visuals for promotion which you can find on my social medias. 
                The characters in each artwork can be accompanied with their own head shots and used in multiple projects.

                My work can fall into a niche usually with music artists. In this space im allowed tons of creative freedom. 
                Putting together artwork that goes with a story or vibe of the music is a fun challenge. This isn't the only 
                avenue it can be taken. 3D works great with twitch streamers, as website graphics, brand mock ups for promotion. 
                It's an innovative way to promote your merch, brand, or self. I like to dabble in different styles from minimalism 
                to jam-packed scenes. The art chosen for this page is some of my most recent favorites. 
                They usually take me 1-3 days to create, sometimes more depending on the intricacy of it all. 
                If you head to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/munkmade"><b style="color: #F28C1D;">Instagram</b></a> 
                you'll get to see all the different projects that I've worked on. 
                Along with my logo/brand work and clips from my animations. If you like what you see or have any questions, 
                let me know. If your a fellow artist or designer I'm always looking to grow the network!
                <br>

                I work with most budgets depending on the concept and how in depth it
                is. Artwork consisting of modeled character(s) tend to be higher in price, same with sceneries that require very 
                busy settings (like city streets). When dealing with a more simplified concept, we can stretch budgets further. 
                Logo work starts in 2D vector art, and can be brought into the 3D space. Cover art can be accompanied with a loop 
                visual for Spotify, or a full visualizer for YouTube. Same goes for brand reveal animations for your new logo.
