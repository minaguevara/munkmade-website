            <p class="text item" id="text-01">Character modeling is one of the main components in the 3D space.
                They can be created for the specific project at hand, used for
                future projects, and can be exported to be used by other animators 
                and artists! The main steps in creating a character are modeling,
                materials and texturing, then rigging for animation.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is the base step. The character will start from a
                            cube (basically a block of clay). This is where I start shaping the head
                            (using reference photos if needed), then basic proportions of the
                            face. Once I'm set with the base head, I`ll connect it to the
                            body. I will then go
                            back with more shaping to get the body type I am looking for,
                            adding more resemblance and personality of
                            the character. This process of character creation can
                            take me 1-3 days to complete.

                            *Remember playing with play-doh or clay? That's me on the
                            computer.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">MATERIALS & TEXTURING</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is where we add everything like skin color,
                            tattoos, freckles, imperfections. Clothing requires different types of
                            fabrics from polyester to a silk or satin. In order for all of this to
                            look correct (no distorting or stretching) I have to go into "UV Mapping".
                            <br><br>                            
                            [UV Mapping]: For textures to lay correctly on an object, the
                            mesh framework needs to be unwrapped. Picture a globe in front
                            of you. In order to make a flat map of it, you need to add a split that
                            allows the sphere to open and lay flat without warping any of the imagery.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <button class="accordion">RIGGING</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Now that the character is modeled and textured, 
                            we can create a "rig" to control the character. A rig is the
                            skeleton of the model. To make the character walk it needs
                            bones, then I animate each bone to create a walk cycle. A
                            single rig can be used for multiple characters, as long as they are the 
                            same type of being. A dog has a different rig than a human for instance.
                            <br><br>
                            The creation of a rig will not usually impact
                            pricing or workflow. But there are times when a specifically required
                            rig is needed. Maybe for a snake, or some type of alien lifeform. Either
                            way they need to be individually applied to each character, with
                            different steps depending on the model.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">ANIMATION</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is where we add motion and bring the characters to life.
                            Using the rig that is now set to the character, we can animate using
                            keyframes to que each position during the timeline.
                            <br>
                            *If you want your character to punch, I need to animate their
                            fingers to curl into a ball, raise their fist, throw their arm
                            forward, then everything within the impact and retreat of their fist. That's
                            just the arm, the whole body needs to be animated to
                            sell the realism of the punch. The twisting hips, bending neck,
                            squinting eyes, etc... OH and are they punching another character?
                            The punched person needs to be animated as well, receiving the blow.
                            <br><br>
                            This is the longest portion of character creation. Depending on what is being
                            animated, the amount of hours needed to complete can add up
                            quickly. It is much simpler to have a character walking,
                            than to be sprinting. And so on, as sprinting is less complex than a fight
                            scene.
                            <br><br>
                            Animation is a major area to think about when considering the budget and
                            time frame needed to be complete.</p>
