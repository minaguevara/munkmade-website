            <p class="text item" id="text-01">Character modeling is one of the main components in the 3D space.
                they can be created for the specific project at hand, used for
                future projects, and can be exported to be used by other animators 
                and artists! The main steps in creating a character are modeling,
                materials and texturing, then rigging for animation.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is the base step. The character firstly will start from a
                            cube (basically a block of clay). This is where I start shaping the head
                            (using reference photos if needed), then the basic proportions of the
                            face. Once I make a set mold of the head, I will move down to the full
                            body to make a basic set up.. you know, torso and limbs. I will then go
                            back with more specific edits to get the body type I am looking for, and
                            added details to the body and face for resembelance and/or personality of
                            the character. This is a long process of character creation and can
                            sometimes take me 1-3 days alone to complete.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is where we add everything like skin color,
                            tattoos, freckles, imperfections. Clothing requires different types of
                            fabrics from polyester to a silk or satin. In order for all of this to
                            look correct (no distorting or stretching) then I have to enter the
                            sub-category of "UV Mapping".
                            <br><br>                            
                            [UV Mapping]: For textures to lay correctly on an object, the objects
                            mesh framework needs to be unwrapped. Simply put, picture a globe in front
                            of you. In order to make a flat map of it, you need to add a split that
                            allows the sphere to open and lay flat without warping any of the imagery.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <button class="accordion">RIGGING</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Now that the character is modeled and texured, 
                            we can create a "rig" to control the character. A rig is primarily the
                            skeleton of the model. For example, to make the character walk it needs
                            bones, and I then need to animate each bone to create a walk cycle. A
                            single rig can be used for multiple characters, as long as they are the 
                            same type of being. A dog has a different rig than a human for instance.
                            <br><br>
                            The creation of a rig is not something that will usually impact
                            pricing or workflow. But there are times when a specifically required
                            rig is needed. Maybe for a snake, or some type of alien lifeform. Either
                            way they do need to be individually applied to each character, with some
                            more tidious then others depending on the model.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">ANIMATION</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>This is where we add motion and bring the characters to life.
                            Using the rig that is now set to the character, we can animate using
                            timed keyframes to que each position during the timeline.
                            <br>
                            *If you want your character to punch, I then need to animate their
                            fingers to curl into a ball, raise their fist, throw their arm
                            foward, then everything within the impact and retreat of their fist. That
                            is just his arm, the whole body needs to be animated at well to fully
                            sell the realism of the punch. The twisting hips, bending in the neck,
                            squinting of the eyes, etc.. OH and is he punching another character?
                            The now punched person needs to be animated as well, recieving the blow.
                            <br><br>
                            This is an extreme brief of the process, as it is longest and most
                            tedious area of character creation. Depending on what exactly is being
                            animated is the amount of hours needed to complete it and can add up
                            quickly. It is much simpler to have a character organically standing,
                            than to be walking. and it continues, as walking is simpler then a fight
                            scene.
                            <br><br>
                            Animation is a major area to think about when considering the budget and
                            time frame needed to be complete.</p>
